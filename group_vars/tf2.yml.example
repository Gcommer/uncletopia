  Welcome to Uncletopia! If you enjoyed your time here, remember to add this server to your favorites via the server browser!
  This is Uncle Dane's custom community server. The experience on Uncletopia is intended to be very similar to TF2 Casual Mode, with a few quality-of-life changes. If youâ€™d like to learn more, please visit -- UNCLETOPIA.COM -- You can easily connect with the Uncletopia community, give feedback, report players, and access other resources by joining the official Uncletopia Discord at -- UNCLETOPIA.COM/DISCORD --
  If teams are unbalanced, type !scramble in chat to vote to scramble the teams. If you would like to change the current map, you can nominate a map with !nominate and rock the vote with !rtv. There is a no-tolerance policy against slurs and toxicity. Thanks for playing!
